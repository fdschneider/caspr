#' The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised
#' by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
#' 
#' The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by
#' its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of
#' Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or,
#' for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
#' 
#' \strong{Rules}
#' 
#' The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
#' grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive
#' or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells
#' that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
#' time, the following transitions occur:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused 
#'     by under-population.
#'   \item Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next 
#'     generation.
#'   \item Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by 
#'     overcrowding.
#'   \item Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, 
#'     as if by reproduction.
#' }
#' 
#' The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation
#' is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the
#' seed - births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which
#' this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a
#' pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied
#' repeatedly to create further generations.
