\details{
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised
by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by
its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of
Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or,
for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

\strong{Rules}

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive
or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
time, the following transitions occur:

\itemize{
  \item Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused 
    by under-population.
  \item Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next 
    generation.
  \item Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by 
    overcrowding.
  \item Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, 
    as if by reproduction.
}

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation
is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the
seed - births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which
this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a
pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied
repeatedly to create further generations.
