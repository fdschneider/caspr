\title{summary method for `ca_result`}
\usage{
\method{summary}{ca_result}(x, length.eval = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{}

\item{length.eval}{Number of time steps at the end of the simulation to consider
when computing mean and sd of covers}
}
\value{
Returns a list \code{out} containing the model name, the final time,
  the mean cover  and standard deviation in the last 10 timesteps.
}
\description{
summary method for `ca_result`
}
\note{
The mean and sd are supposed to depend on the model being in steady
  state dynamics, i.e. beyond transitory. Lacking a universal criterion for
  that, we report the final 10 timesteps.
